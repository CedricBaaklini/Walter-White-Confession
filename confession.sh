echo "Shortly after my fiftieth birthday, Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition."

sleep 5

echo "He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in tthe drug world, connections that he made through his career with the DEA."

sleep 5

echo "I was astounded."

sleep 5

echo "I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time."

sleep 5

echo "Something he knew and took advantage of."

sleep 5

echo "Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make."

sleep 5

echo "From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, of which Fring flatly refused to give it, and things escalated."

echo "Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess..."

sleep 5

echo "I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his mmedical bills, which amounted to a litte over $177,000."

echo "Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge."

sleep 5

echo "Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so."

sleep 5

echo "I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened."

sleep 5

echo "Hank had risen in the reigns to become head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time to keep me in line, he took my children from me, for three months he kept him."

sleep 5

echo "My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done."

sleep 5

echo "Why Hank had taken our children."

sleep 5

echo "We were scared."

sleep 5

echo "And I was in Hell."
